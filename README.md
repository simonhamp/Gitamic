# Gitamic
Gitamic adds an interactive git UI to Statamic so that you can have more control over your commits. It's great for more
complex sites that rely on live-publishing changes from your Statamic CP back to your git repository.

## Features
- See changes to files (a.k.a. your 'working tree')
- Stage and unstage changes
- Commit changes
- Push changes

And even more features are coming as Gitamic is under active development!

## Installation and Setup
### Statamic CP
Using the Statamic CP is the easiest way to install Gitamic. Under **Tools > Addons**, use the search to find 'Gitamic'
and install. All done.

### Composer
You can also install via Composer:

```bash
composer require simonhamp/gitamic
```

Once Composer has finished downloading the necessary dependencies, you'll need to update your application's
`config/statamic/editions.php` to indicate which version of Gitamic you wish to use (`basic` or `pro`):

```php
    'addons' => [
        'simonhamp/gitamic' => 'basic',
    ],
```

Gitamic is a premium add-on, so a license is required for all versions. You may download and install it for free to
trial it, but you must purchase a license in order to use this add-on in production.

You can purchase a license from the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons/simonhamp/gitamic).

Once Gitamic is installed, you can use it immediately. It relies on wherever your site is running to contain a git
repository.

Gitamic **does not** require Statamic Pro, nor [Statamic's Git integration](https://statamic.dev/git-integration) to be
enabled. If however you do have Statamic's Git integration enabled, you may find it better to _disable_ its 'automatic
commits' feature.

To do this you can set the following key in your `.env` file:

```dotenv
STATAMIC_GIT_AUTOMATIC=false
```
