## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

**DO NOT REPORT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES AS ISSUES ON GITHUB**

Instead, send an email to simon.hamp@me.com with the subject line `Gitamic Security`.
Your report will be acknowledged within 48 hours.

Please provide as much detail as possible to allow me to assess and reproduce
the vulnerability.

If your report is accepted as a vulnerability, I will work on a fix. You will be
notified once the fix has been released.

## Rewards

The reporter of an accepted vulnerability report will receive a single-use discount code
equivalent to 100% off a single Gitamic license **once the vulnerability has been mitigated**.

There is no cash alternative.
